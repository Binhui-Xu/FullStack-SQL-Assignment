    1.	What is View? What are the benefits of using views?
        A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and 
        columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in 
        the database. You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the date as if the data
        were from one single table.
            --> a view can limit the degree of exposure of the underlying to the outer wrold
            --> view can join and simplify multiple tables into a single virtual table
            --> view can act as aggregated tables, where the database engine aggregate data and present the 
                calculated results as part of the data
            --> views can hide complexity of data
            --> view takes very little space to store; the database contains only the definition of view, not 
                a copy of all the data that it presents
            --> view can provide extra security
    2.	Can data be modified through views?
        You can't directly modify data in views based on union queries. You can't modify data in views that use
        GROUP BY or DISTINCT statements. All columns being modified are subject to the same restrictions as if 
        the statements were being executed directly against the base table.
    3.	What is stored procedure and what are the benefits of using it?
        A stored procedures is a set of SQL statements with an assigned name, which are stored in a relational database
        management system as a group, so it can be resued and shared by multiple programs.
            --> A stored procudures preserves data integrity because information is entered in a consistent manner. It improves
                productivity because statements in a stored procudure only must be written once
            --> Stored producures offer advantages over embedding queries in a GUI.
            --> Use of stored procedures can reduce network traffic between clients and servers, because the commands are executed
                as a single batch of code.
    4.	What is the difference between view and stored procedure?
        View is simple showcasing data stored in the database tables whereas a stored producre is group of statements that can 
        be executed. a view is faster as it displays data from the tables referenced whereas a store procedure executes sql statement.
    5.	What is the difference between stored procedure and functions?
        Stored producures and functions can be used to accomplish the same task. Both can be custom-defined as part of any application,
        but functions are designed to send their output to a query or T-SQL statement. Stored producures are designed to return outputs
        to the application, while a user-defined function returns table variables and connot change the server envirionment or operating
        system environment.
    6.	Can stored procedure return multiple result sets?
        Most stored procedures return multiple result sets. Such a stored procedure usually includes one or more select statements.
    7.	Can stored procedure be executed as part of SELECT Statement? Why?
        Stored producre are typically executed with an EXEC statement. However, you can execute a stored producure implicity from
        within a SELECT statement, provide that the storedprocedure returns a result set.
    8.	What is Trigger? What types of Triggers are there?
        A trigger is a stored producure in database which automatocally invokes whenever a special event in the database occurs.
            --> Data Definition Language(DDL) Trigger 
            --> Data Manipulation Language(DML) Trigger
            --> Common Language Runtime(CLR) Trigger
            --> Logon Trigger
    9.	What are the scenarios to use Triggers?
        Auditing and enforcing business rules
    10.	What is the difference between Trigger and Stored Procedure?
        Stored procedures are a pieces of the code in written in PL/SQL to do some specific task. Stored procedures can be invoked
        explicitly by the user. It's like a java program , it can take some input as a parameter then can do some processing and can return values.
        On the other hand,  trigger is a stored procedure that runs automatically when various events happen (eg update, insert, delete). 
        Triggers are more like an event handler they run at the specific event. Trigger can not take input and they canâ€™t return values.
